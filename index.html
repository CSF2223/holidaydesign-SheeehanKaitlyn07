              <h3> While much of the world’s Christian community embraces Santa Claus or St. Nick, Russians welcome Ded Moroz each year, an ancient figure
from Slavic mythology. Also called Father Frost, the Santa-like character brings gifts to children, except he delivers them on New Year’s Eve.
(This stems from the Bolshevik Revolution when the government banned anything religious, including Christmas.) Ded Moroz traditionally wears a
full-length blue coat, so as not to be confused with Santa, and is accompanied by his granddaughter, Snegurochka, or Snow Maiden. Even though
it's become more common for Ded Moroz to wear red, he maintains the tradition of carrying a staff and riding in a sleigh pulled by three white horses.</h3>

              <h3> Christmas trees are popular in Greece, but you’ll also find boats wrapped in strings of lights, whether in the water or in the main square.
There are two explanations for the boat-decorating phenomenon: The first is that the country’s ancient maritime tradition means boats have always
been an integral part of the culture, so they were decorated long before a modernized version of Christmas (including trees) came along.
The second is that St. Nicholas is considered the patron saint of sailors, which is probably why boats are decorated on December 6th. </h3>

              <h3> You’ve likely heard of a Yule log, but how about a Yule goat? Throughout Scandinavia, especially Sweden, Norway and Finland,
locals celebrate a variation of the Santa Claus legend, which involves him riding a goat instead of a sleigh pulled by reindeer.
As such, it’s common to find goat ornaments everywhere. Although the town of Gävle, Sweden does one better by erecting a larger-than-life
straw goat in the town square (whose size has even made the Guinness Book of World Records). The goat structure is meant to last from
Advent until New Year’s Day, but perhaps more noteworthy than its size is the annual unofficial sabotaging of said goat, since it inevitably
gets burned to the ground more often than not. </h3>
